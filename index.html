				<h1>Tommi Carleman</h1>

				<p class="lead">I'm a web developer from Finland, living in Denmark - I have around 10 years of experience in web development field, doing both front-end (HTML, CSS and JS) and back-end positions (PHP).</p>

				<p>
					Throughout the years I have worked with many different systems, from CMS systems like <a href="https://wordpress.org/" rel="nofollow">WordPress</a> and <a href="https://ez.no/" rel="nofollow">eZ Publish</a>, to frameworks like <a href="https://silex.symfony.com/" rel="nofollow">Silex</a> and <a href="https://laravel.com/" rel="nofollow">Laravel</a>.
				</p>

				<p>
					Some of the projects that I have been involved in are for example creating a <a href="./projects/kpi_dashboard.pdf" rel="nofollow">KPI Dashboard for a SEO Agency</a>, a <a href="./projects/leadbooster.pdf" rel="nofollow">lead generation</a> tool aimed to help clients and a <a href="./projects/helpdesks.pdf" rel="nofollow">network of helpdesks</a> for multiple clients to improve their search visibility.
				</p>

				<p>
					Through the years I have also worked with transforming designs created with Photoshop and Sketch App to working HTML, CSS and JS solutions, and installed them to Wordpress sites using either a theme builder, or hand-crafted custom themes for the sites. I have also done the same with Umbraco as the backend system.
				</p>

				<p>
					Some of the websites that I have worked on through the years are <a href="https://www.eurodan-huse.dk" rel="nofollow noindex">Eurodan huse</a>, <a href="https://globalforsikring.dk" rel="nofollow noindex">Global forsikring</a>, <a href="https://pastella.dk" rel="nofollow noindex">Pastella</a>, <a href="https://laerkelunden.dk" rel="nofollow noindex">Lærkelunden</a>,  <a href="https://www.planteshop.dk/" rel="nofollow noindex">Planteshop</a>, <a href="https://cado.dk" rel="nofollow noindex">Cado</a>, <a href="https://engroshjul.dk" rel="nofollow noindex">Engroshjul</a>, <a href="http://legeakademietblog.dk" rel="noindex nofollow">a blog for Legeakademiet</a>, <a href="https://schmidt-koekken.dk" rel="noindex nofollow">Schmidt Køkken</a> and many more.
				</p>

				<p>
					I've set my sights to become a proper full-stack developer.
